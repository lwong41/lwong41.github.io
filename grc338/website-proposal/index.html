            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Stardust Cosmetics </p>
            
            <p>Stardust Cosmetics is based in San Francisco, CA and prides itself on being cruelty free and sustainable. Additionally, we have an on-going program that focuses on donating some of the proceeds to various charities around the world. Who says you can't be beautiful while also helping the earth and your community! </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience is young adult females and males that are interested in a cosmetic company that is cruelty free, sustainable, and dedicated to giving back to the community. 
                
            Stardust Cosmetics doesn't test any products on animals which ensures that they only carry cruelty free products. Additionally, they make products in reusable containers that can be refilled in shop. And lastly, once a month, Stardust Cosmetics chooses a weekend where 10% of every sale gets donated to a random charity. </p>
           
            <p>Stardust Cosmetics goals include providing cosmetics to consumers that is made with safe ingredients and is made cruelty free (mainly focusing on having no animal testing associated with the product), creating a sustainable brand to help decrease the amount of waste produced daily, and to give back to the community in whatever way possible. Stardust Cosmetics wants its customers to feel proud to use their cosmetics and to feel like they are making a different while looking beautiful.</p>
